A variable is a label used to store information.

Strings are letters and numbers that live inside quotation marks.  They can be whatever they want to be and can even include spaces!

Functions are instructions for a computer to follow.

An argument is a value that is passed into a function.

Return statements are a way of escaping a function and returning the results of the computer following the set of instructions given to it in a function.

If statements are tests that arguments take.  If the argument passes the test, the instructions that follow the test are carried out.  If it fails the test, the instructions are not followed.  There is no reward for a failed test.

Boolean values are the answers true and false.  However, arguments are tricky and can sometimes trick a test into passing or failing them!
