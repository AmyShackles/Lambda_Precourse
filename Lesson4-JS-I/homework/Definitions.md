A variable is a label used to store data.

A string is text that can contain words or numbers and that is contained using quotes.

Functions are programs that run code.

An argument is a value that is passed into a function.

Return statements end functions and return a value from the function.

If statements are used to check if something is true or false.  If true, the code works.  If false, the code does not.  If statements can be more complicated by allowing a person to write an if else statement such that if the condition is false, a different thing happens, etc.

Boolean values are either true or false and nothing else.
