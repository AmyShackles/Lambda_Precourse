A prototype is a parent property for an object.  When objects are created, the object that created them passes on everything that they have (properties, methods, etc.), but the child object is its own object and can change itself so that it isn't an exact clone of its parent.  One of the things objects inherit from their parents is called a prototype, which is a property that gives the object its basic shape.  Every object builds on top of the prototype to become the object they end up being.  You can put functions on a prototype for an object so that the instructions from that function get followed by every object that that object creates without having to manually assign the function to each individual object.

Constructors are functions that create objects.  They can be used to create a class, which is an object that serves as a template for making other objects that fit into the same category and have a lot of the same properties.  This allows you to create objects within the class without having to type the properties over and over (you only have to type the values for the properties for each new object).
