A prototype is the way in which a class can set a method and have it be accessible to every object in the class.  This saves memory so that a function doesn't have to be run for every object in the same way as it would have to be if it was written out for every instance of its use.

Constructors are like classes, which is like a template for how to create similar objects.  Classes are created by using 'new' and then naming the class with an uppercase variable name.
