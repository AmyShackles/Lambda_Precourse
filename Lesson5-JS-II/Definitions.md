A for loop is something that executes code over and over until the statement in the loop is no longer true.

&& means 'and'.  In a piece of code, it is helpful in evaluating two or more conditions, returning only if all expressions using && are true.

|| means 'or'.  In a piece of code, it is helpful in evaluating two or more conditions, returning if any condition using || is true.

! means 'not'.  It is useful in evaluating the condition of whether something is not something else.  !false would be true.
